Total classification error 10
Explanation: each missed classification is 1 output value away (no observed instances of a garbage prediction).
Therefore can just add up the number of missed classifications
[Setosa] Precision: 0.625 Recall: 1
[Versicolour] Precision: -nan(ind) Recall: 0
[Virginia] Precision: 0.714286 Recall: 1

 Number of iterations: 70
The number of iterations was used as a terminating criteria.
This value was chosen empirically as around the minimum number of iterations needed to converge on acceptable weight values.
A higher number of iterations did not result in any more correct classifications.
